		This applications listens for fax tones (on IAX and SIP channels too)

		If digits interrupt, they must be the start of a valid extension unless 
		the option is included to ignore. If fax is detected, it will jump to the 
		'fax' extension. If a period of non-silence greater than 'mindur' ms, 
		yet less than 'maxdur' ms is followed by silence at least 'sildur' ms
