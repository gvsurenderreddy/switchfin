  https://switchfin.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/switchfin/switchfin/tags/br4-ui2.15/  (for BR4Appliance)

  If you need latest stable Asterisk (1.4.28) You may consider testing 
  the SwitchFin trunk. Note that PRI driver in the the trunk is still 
  not ported completely so please don't use trunk for PR1 Apliance yet

* WHAT IS SwitchFin ?
  SwitchFin is an Open Source uClinux/Asterisk based distribution
  runing on top of Blackfin CPUs from Analog Devices www.analog.com
  DSP processors. The compilation result is
  uBoot for the hardware target you have selected
  image file you need to load in your target so you turn the hardware
  in the useful PBX.

* History
  SwitchFin is an branch of Astfin (astfin.org) telephony uClinux/Asterisk 
  based distribution.
  Why this project was created? Well at the begining of 2010 me and few 
  colegues I was working with, had become one of the major contributors 
  for Astfin 2.1 project. The project father Mark however has shared with 
  us that he wants Astfin to migrate a bit out of telephony area which is 
  not exactly what we see its future. 
  We want to work on a purely telephony oriented project and that's why
  we have created SwitchFin. 
  Lets wish SwitchFin to become useful peace in the global open source 
  society.

  For more information on the project itself, please visit the

* SUPPORTED DEVELOPMENT OPERATING SYSTEMS

  The SwitchFin is developed and tested primarily on the GNU/Linux operating
  system, and is supported on every major GNU/Linux distribution.

* GETTING STARTED
  To be able to compile SwitchFin you can use any popular Linux distribution
  like Fedora, Debian, Ubuntu, CentOS, etc

  In order to use the compiled images you will need one of the following 
  supported targets:

	BR4 Appliance
	PR1 Appliance
	IP08
	IP02
	IP01
	IP01p
	FX08

* NEW INSTALLATIONS

  SwitchFin requires lzo and lzo-devel packages. It will download and install 
  GNU C Compiler Collection (GCC) cross compilation toolchain

So let's proceed:

1) Read this README file.

2) Run "make uBoot" 

   this will compile u-boot and the result u-boot.ldr will be stored in 
   {switchfin_root}/build_{target}/image_{target}/ 

3) Run "make menuconfig" in the SwitchFin directory

  Execute the menuconfig target so you adjust:
  Target Architecture (one of BR4/PR1/IP0x/FX0x)
  Kernel settings
  Package Selection for the target (include/exclude various optional
  pacjkages, select the amount type of the SDRAM/FLASH etc.)

4) Run "make" in the SwitchFin directory

  This will download and install the toolchain if reaquired,
  will download and install all of the required components like Asterisk, 
  mISDN etc.
  Assuming the build completes successfully:

5) Run "make image" in the SwitchFin directory

  This will prepare the images to be downloaded in your hardware target.
  The images are produced in {switchfin_root}/build_{target}/image_{target}/ 
  and you will get there:
  u-boot.ldr - uboot image to be loaded in the target hardware using 
               JTAG tool
  uImage     - target image you can load in the hardware.
               uboot loader should be up an druning on it.
  uImage-md5 - image with the attached 32 bytes MD5 checksum for 
               noise protection.
